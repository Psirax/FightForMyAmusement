Welcome to the Arena Project.

The entire purpose of this project is to teach programming principles. This project will evolve
to show why functions and Object Oriented Programming principles are useful. Many times, 
students are given small programs that use OOP principles, but the program lacks the size and 
complexity to really show the advantages of such things. This program (and the repository that
contains it) is designed to provide a learner with a large enough playground to understand WHY
OOP principles are actually useful and not just unnecessary and confusing.
